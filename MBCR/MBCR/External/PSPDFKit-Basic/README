You need at least Xcode 4.4.1 with Clang to compile.

And a reminder, PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THE SOURCE CODE.
I update often and refactor quite mercyless. You'll gonna have a hard time merging changes.
The correct way is subclassing and using the overrideClassNames feature of PSPDFViewController and PSPDFDocument.
For examples, check ot PSPDFCatalog.
